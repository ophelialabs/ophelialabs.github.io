            <p>A Lead Java Developer orchestrates diverse technologies to build complex systems. Hereâ€™s how the stack comes together for a recommendation engine for a large e-commerce platform:</p>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Core Microservices (Java/Kotlin & J2EE):</strong> The backbone is a set of high-performance microservices. A <code>UserProfile-Service</code> (Java) manages user data, while a <code>Recommendation-Service</code> (Kotlin) serves recommendations via REST API, built on frameworks like Micronaut or Spring Boot.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Data Science & Machine Learning (Python):</strong> ML models are trained to predict user preferences. A Python service (FastAPI) exposes these models for real-time querying.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Diverse Data Storage (SQL/NoSQL):</strong>
                    <ul class="mt-2 text-muted">
                        <li><strong>Postgres/SQL Server (RDBMS):</strong> Stores structured, critical data like user accounts and the product catalog.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cassandra (NoSQL):</strong> Captures massive streams of user event data (clicks, views, purchases) for offline model training, leveraging its high write throughput.</li>
                        <li><strong>Graph DB (e.g., Neo4j):</strong> Stores relationships (e.g., "Users who bought X also bought Y") for generating fast, real-time "people also bought" recommendations.</li>
                        <li><strong>MongoDB (NoSQL):</strong> Used to store flexible data like user session information or A/B testing configurations in a document format.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Infrastructure & DevOps (Cloud, Kubernetes, Drone, Chef/Ansible):</strong>
                    <ul class="mt-2 text-muted">
                        <li><strong>Cloud Tech:</strong> The entire infrastructure runs on a major cloud provider like GCP or Azure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kubernetes:</strong> All microservices (Java, Kotlin, Python) are packaged into containers and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability, resilience, and isolation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drone (CI/CD):</strong> When a developer commits code, a Drone pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys the service to Kubernetes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chef/Ansible:</strong> Configures the underlying virtual machines that form the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring they are standardized and secure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Ruby:</strong> A smaller script, perhaps written in Ruby, could be used for periodic data cleanup or reporting tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A "full-cycle implementation" means leading a project from idea to production and maintenance. Here is a detailed roadmap for our Recommendation Engine project.</p>
