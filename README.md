## Come up with a unified plan. Build instead of rewrite
 - json/xml (scix is multi-disciplinary but still does not include certain domain sources)
 - python was suggested for api call, personal preference is blazor but all the same

## Use APIs from each source
 - provide search landing page for results
 - normalize data, and present it, often with unified search syntax (AND,OR,NOT) and a frontend interface

### 1. Identify and Access APIs
 - Science Advances/Elsevier


1. Architecture & Prerequisites
 
Before writing code, you must obtain developer credentials. Elsevier access is particularly strict and often requires institutional affiliation.
SciX (NASA ADS): Free & Open. Requires an API Token generated from the [SciX UI](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/)under Settings.
Elsevier (Scopus): Restricted. Requires an API Key from the Elsevier Developer Portal. Full text often requires an Institutional Token or campus VPN.
Backend Stack: Python is recommended due to mature wrapper libraries: ads (for SciX) and elsapy or [pybliometrics](https://pybliometrics.readthedocs.io/) (for Elsevier).
2. Python Implementation Guide
The following example demonstrates how to wrap both APIs into a unified service using Flask. You will need to install ads, elsapy, and flask.

```
import ads
from elsapy.elsclient import ElsClient
from elsapy.elssearch import ElsSearch
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# --- Configuration ---
# Ensure ADS_DEV_KEY is set in your environment variables
ELSEVIER_API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
client = ElsClient(ELSEVIER_API_KEY)
# client.inst_token = "YOUR_INST_TOKEN" # Required for full access

def query_scix(topic):
    """Wraps the official ads library."""
    results = []
    try:
        papers = ads.SearchQuery(q=topic, rows=5, fl=['title', 'author', 'year', 'bibcode', 'doi'])
        for p in papers:
            results.append({
                "source": "SciX",
                "title": p.title[0] if p.title else "Untitled",
                "year": p.year,
                "doi": p.doi[0] if p.doi else None
            })
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"SciX Error: {e}")
    return results

def query_elsevier(topic):
    """Wraps the elsapy library."""
    results = []
    try:
        search = ElsSearch(topic, 'scopus')
        search.execute(client, get_all=False)
        # Normalizing Elsevier's complex JSON structure
        for item in search.results[:5]:
            results.append({
                "source": "Elsevier",
                "title": item.get('dc:title', 'Untitled'),
                "year": item.get('prism:coverDate', '')[:4],
                "doi": item.get('prism:doi')
            })
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Elsevier Error: {e}")
    return results

@app.route('/api/search')
def unified_search():
    query = request.args.get('q')
    # In production, run these in parallel (AsyncIO)
    results = query_scix(query) + query_elsevier(query)
    return jsonify(results)
```

3. Key Integration Challenges
Data Normalization: SciX returns year while Elsevier returns prism:coverDate. Your backend must map these to a single standard field (e.g., publication_year) before sending data to the frontend.
Rate Limiting: SciX limits requests (e.g., 5,000/day). Implement Redis caching for identical queries to avoid burning your quota on repeated searches.
Authentication Barriers: Elsevier APIs are IP-restricted. If you deploy this backend to a cloud server (AWS/Heroku), it will lose your university's IP authorization. You may need to register your server's IP with Elsevier or use an Institutional Token.

To build a backend service that searches for articles across multiple resources like SciX and Elsevier, you should implement an API aggregator or middleware architecture. This involves interacting with each provider's specific API and normalizing the results into a unified format. 
1. Register for API Access 
Each service requires its own authentication credentials: 
Elsevier: Register on the Elsevier Developer Portal to obtain an API Key. Access is generally free for non-commercial academic research, though some advanced features require institutional subscriptions.
SciX: This service uses the ADS (Astrophysics Data System) API. You can obtain an API token by creating an account at NASA/ADS. 
2. Backend Implementation (Example in Python)
You can use a backend framework like FastAPI or Flask to handle search requests and query both services simultaneously. 
Elsevier Integration: Use the scopus or ScienceDirect API endpoints. Libraries like pybliometrics can simplify interaction with Scopus.
SciX Integration: Use the NASA/ADS API endpoint: api.adsabs.harvard.edu. Send your API token in the HTTP header for all requests. 
3. Proposed Backend Workflow
To search both resources efficiently in 2026, follow these steps:
Receive Query: Accept a single search query from your frontend.
Parallel Requests: Use asynchronous calls (e.g., asyncio or httpx in Python) to send the query to both Elsevier and SciX simultaneously.
Data Normalization: Map different response structures to a standard internal schema (e.g., matching field names like title, author, doi, and date). Note that Elsevier's JSON can vary between single objects and arrays for certain fields.
Deduplication & Ranking: Combine the results, remove duplicates based on DOI, and rank them by relevance.
Return Unified Response: Send the final list of articles back to your user. 
4. Technical Considerations
Rate Limits: Both APIs enforce rate limits and quotas; your backend must handle 429 Too Many Requests responses gracefully.
Syntax Translation: Different databases use slightly different search syntax. You may need to translate a user's query into the specific syntax for each database (e.g., ScienceDirect uses double quotes for phrases and Boolean operators like AND/OR).
API Tokens: Store your keys securely in environment variables (e.g., .env files) and never expose them in client-side code. 
These guides detail API access, integration methods, and search syntax for Elsevier and SciX (ADS) services:

 - [SciX](https://ads.harvard.edu/handouts/SciX_API_handout.pdf)

To use a backend service for multi-resource article search (like SciX & Elsevier), you'll need to leverage their specific APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) by obtaining API keys, constructing HTTP requests with your search parameters, and processing the returned JSON/XML data, often using a central backend service (like a Python/Node.js server or an enterprise search platform like [Backstage](https://www.google.com/search?q=Backstage&newwindow=1&sca_esv=8246e02b3da205e5&sxsrf=AE3TifN9ArtR6gcvz3tX4-E-IRxkZ6ISJQ%3A1767809226160&ei=yqBeae7CCcWYwbkPhoXngQc&ved=2ahUKEwiYgM3y8fqRAxUw5MkDHVSPOb0QgK4QegQIARAB&uact=5&oq=how+to+use+backend+service+to+search+for+articles+from+multiple+resources%2C+i.e.-+scix+and+Elsevier&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiYmhvdyB0byB1c2UgYmFja2VuZCBzZXJ2aWNlIHRvIHNlYXJjaCBmb3IgYXJ0aWNsZXMgZnJvbSBtdWx0aXBsZSByZXNvdXJjZXMsIGkuZS4tIHNjaXggYW5kIEVsc2V2aWVySMWHA1AAWOODA3ACeAGQAQCYAd0CoAGggAGqAQoyMS41Mi4yNi4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAI-oAKtVMICBBAjGCfCAgsQABiABBiKBRiRAsICDhAuGIAEGLEDGMcBGNEDwgILEC4YgAQYxwEY0QPCAgsQLhiABBixAxiDAcICERAuGIAEGLEDGIMBGMcBGNEDwgIREC4YgAQYigUYsQMYxwEY0QPCAgsQABiABBixAxiDAcICBRAAGIAEwgIFEC4YgATCAggQABiABBixA8ICCBAuGIAEGLEDwgILEAAYgAQYigUYsQPCAg4QABiABBiKBRixAxiDAcICBBAAGAPCAgYQABgWGB7CAgsQABiABBiKBRiGA8ICBRAAGO8FwgIIEAAYgAQYogTCAggQABiJBRiiBMICBRAhGKABwgIFECEYqwLCAgUQIRifBcICBxAhGAoYoAGYAwCSBwoxMi4yNy4yMi4xoAfjtgOyBwoxMS4yNy4yMi4xuAenVMIHCjAuMi41My42LjHIB_QCgAgB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&zx=1767809319110&no_sw_cr=1&mstk=AUtExfDXkUwtdv7RfHKiHr2R6SZ0efzkwHAMpK1js9PRL_vCFKxpo_PlOhawRQre7gbg1h3XfurVIxKcOfugfNUOM8v4yPt7nGE5NOxNYVho7Pew-icIvc60PUw2t56EPc4j_U_wd_ibTRGiYSRKbC7OORNCyhu4oHqCS1AtGuOeXv1fgMbadyLL4SMa9siUDaEps4CMJKaXy0L03Wp9rstzjiGK7hSdLjrtu79vnPyeaKgJlz9TZzNYhOEMPLNNOBFk3YQ&csui=3)) to manage these calls and aggregate results, handling authentication, error management, and data normalization. 
Here's a breakdown of the process:
1. Get API Access & Credentials
Elsevier: Sign up on the [Elsevier Developer Portal](https://dev.elsevier.com/) to get API keys for services like ScienceDirect or Scopus.
SciX: Get an API token from your SciX account settings (e.g., Account > Customize Settings > API Token).
Authentication: Most APIs require an API Key or security token for authentication, sent in request headers or parameters. 
2. Choose Your Backend Stack
Language: Use Python (with requests), Node.js (with axios or fetch), or another language.
Framework: Consider a web framework (Flask/Django for Python, Express for Node.js) to build your service.
Search Platforms (Optional): For enterprise solutions, platforms like Backstage offer plugins for search aggregation (e.g., @backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-explore). 
3. Build the Search Service (Backend Logic)
Centralized Service: Create a single backend endpoint (e.g., /api/search) that accepts user queries.
API Calls: Inside this endpoint, make separate calls to the Elsevier API and the SciX API.
Request Construction:
Elsevier (ScienceDirect): Use their Journas/Articles APIs with your key and search terms (e.g., q=your_query).
SciX: Construct URLs with your query and API token.
Data Handling: Parse the JSON/XML responses from each API.
Aggregation & Normalization: Combine results, potentially filtering/sorting, and map fields (like title, authors, publication_date) to a consistent internal format. 
4. Example Backend Flow (Conceptual):

```
// Pseudocode for your backend service
function multiSourceSearch(query) {
  // 1. Call Elsevier API
  const elsevierResults = await callElsevierAPI(query, elsevierApiKey);

  // 2. Call SciX API
  const scixResults = await callSciXAPI(query, scixApiKey);

  // 3. Normalize & Combine
  const normalizedElsevier = normalizeElsevier(elsevierResults);
  const normalizedSciX = normalizeSciX(scixResults);

  return [...normalizedElsevier, ...normalizedSciX];
}
```

5. Frontend Integration
Your frontend (web/mobile app) calls your backend endpoint (e.g., /api/search) with the user's search term.
The backend returns the unified results, which the frontend then displays. 
Key Considerations:
Rate Limiting: Be mindful of API usage limits and implement delays if needed.
Error Handling: Gracefully handle API failures (e.g., if one service is down).
Data Filtering: Use advanced search options (Boolean operators, specific fields) in the APIs for better results.
