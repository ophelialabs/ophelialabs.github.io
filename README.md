## COME UP WITH A UNIFIED PLAN, BUILD AND DONT REPEAT
 - json/xml (scix is multi-disciplinary but still does not include certain domain resources)
 - python was suggested for api call, personal preference is blazor but all the same

## Use APIs from each source
 - provide search landing page for results
 - normalize data, and present it, often with unified search syntax (AND,OR,NOT) and a frontend interface

### 1. Identify and Access APIs
 - Science Advances/Elsevier
