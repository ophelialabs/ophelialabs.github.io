just real quick and also not for road driving
**Oh and I also believe the timing chain in this specific instance would have to be set up such as a bike when switching gears, does not make this correct, further training is needed**

 - using cylinder reactivation technology to add an activation kill switch/button/cmd that will effectively elevate (i.e. v6 engine to v12) and when disengaged, the switch/button/cmd gradually displaces expanded liquids (cools down), personally I do not think MRFs will work in conventional car cooling systems due to heat absorption and dissipation, or metal build up fragments that can clog the radiator or give false positives such as a cracked block 

 Cylinder activation (or deactivation) is an engine technology that improves fuel efficiency and reduces emissions by temporarily shutting down some cylinders during light-load driving, making the engine run on fewer cylinders, and then reactivating them when more power is needed, with systems like GM's Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) using complex patterns for smooth operation. It works by using hydraulic lifters to disengage the rocker arms, stopping the intake and exhaust valves, and often deactivating fuel injection in those cylinders, effectively reducing engine displacement on demand. 

 How it works
Detection: The Engine Control Module (ECM) monitors driving conditions (load, speed, driver demand).
Deactivation: When full power isn't needed, the ECM sends oil pressure to special hydraulic lifters.
Locking: This pressure engages a "spring lock" within the rocker arm, effectively disconnecting it from the pushrod and valve.
Cylinder "Sleep": The intake and exhaust valves for that cylinder remain closed, and fuel is cut, making it inactive.
Reactivation: When more power is requested, the oil pressure is released, the lock disengages, and the cylinder returns to full operation.
Dynamic Operation: Modern systems (like GM's DFM) offer numerous cylinder combinations, not just 8-to-4, for smoother power delivery and efficiency. 

Key benefits
Improved Fuel Economy: Running fewer cylinders uses less fuel.
Reduced Emissions: Lower fuel consumption leads to fewer tailpipe emissions.
Seamless Operation: Advanced systems are designed to switch imperceptibly.
