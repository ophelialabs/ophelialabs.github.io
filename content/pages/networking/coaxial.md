In a coaxial cable, the energy flow changes from the solenoid's radial storage to longitudinal transport. While a solenoid moves energy inward to build a field, a coaxial cable guides energy parallel to the wires from a source to a load. ➡️ Step 1: Identify the Fields Consider a cable with an inner conductor (radius \(a\)) and an outer conductor (radius \(b\)). If a current \(I\) flows in the \(+z\) direction and a potential difference \(V\) exists between conductors: Electric Field (\(\mathbf{E}\)): Points radially between conductors, \(\mathbf{E}=\frac{V}{r\ln (b/a)}\^{\mathbf{r}}\).Magnetic Field (\(\mathbf{B}\)): Orbits the inner conductor, \(\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu _{0}I}{2\pi r}\^{\phi }\). ➡️ Step 2: Compute the Poynting Vector The Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}=\frac{1}{\mu _{0}}(\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B})\) determines the direction of energy flow. Using the cross product \(\^{\mathbf{r}}\times \^{\phi }=\^{\mathbf{z}}\):\(\mathbf{S}=\frac{1}{\mu _{0}}\left(\frac{V}{r\ln (b/a)}\^{\mathbf{r}}\times \frac{\mu _{0}I}{2\pi r}\^{\phi }\right)=\frac{VI}{2\pi r^{2}\ln (b/a)}\^{\mathbf{z}}\)Unlike the solenoid, where \(\mathbf{S}\) is radial, here it is axial, meaning energy travels through the vacuum (or dielectric) between the wires. ➡️ Step 3: Total Power Integration Integrating \(\mathbf{S}\) over the cross-sectional area (from \(r=a\) to \(r=b\)):\(P=\int _{a}^{b}\frac{VI}{2\pi r^{2}\ln (b/a)}(2\pi rdr)=\frac{VI}{\ln (b/a)}\int _{a}^{b}\frac{1}{r}dr=VI\)This result proves that the total power delivered to the load is exactly \(P=VI\), with the energy transported entirely through the fields rather than inside the metal conductors. ✅ Answer: In a coaxial cable, the energy flow is longitudinal (\(\^{\mathbf{z}}\) direction) and the total power is \(P=VI\). This highlights a fundamental principle: wires do not "carry" power; they guide the fields that carry it.

Analysis of Lossy SystemsWhen a coaxial cable is no longer ideal, the Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}\) tilts away from the purely axial (\(\^{\mathbf{z}}\)) direction toward the conductors.Resistance in Wires: In a real wire with resistance, the electric field is not exactly zero inside the conductor. According to Ohm's Law (\(\mathbf{J}=\sigma \mathbf{E}\)), an axial electric field component (\(E_{z}\)) must exist to drive the current. This \(E_{z}\) component, when crossed with the azimuthal magnetic field \(B_{\phi }\), creates a radial Poynting vector component (\(S_{r}\)) pointing into the wire. This represents energy leaving the field to be dissipated as Joule heating (\(I^{2}R\)) within the conductor.Dielectric Losses: If the material between the conductors (the dielectric) is "leaky" or lossy, it has a non-zero conductivity \(\sigma _{d}\). This induces a small longitudinal electric field or phase shift in the radial field. The resulting Poynting vector tilts slightly inward toward the dielectric material, representing energy absorbed and dissipated as heat within the insulation.Tilt Angle: The "tilt" is the ratio of dissipated power to transmitted power. In high-quality cables, this angle is extremely small, but it fundamentally explains why energy must constantly be supplied by the source to maintain a steady current against resistive losses.

To calculate the tilt angle \(\theta \), we consider a coaxial cable with a current \(I\) and an inner conductor of radius \(a\) made of copper with resistivity \(\rho \). ➡️ Step 1: Identify Field Components at the Surface At the surface of the inner conductor (\(r=a\)), two electric field components exist if the wire has resistance: Radial Component (\(E_{r}\)): The field driving energy transport, related to the voltage \(V\).Axial Component (\(E_{z}\)): The field required to overcome resistance, derived from Ohm's Law \(\mathbf{J}=\sigma \mathbf{E}\). Since \(J=\frac{I}{\pi a^{2}}\) and \(\sigma =\frac{1}{\rho }\):\(E_{z}=\rho J=\frac{\rho I}{\pi a^{2}}\) The magnetic field at the surface is \(\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu _{0}I}{2\pi a}\^{\phi }\). ➡️ Step 2: Determine Poynting Vector Components The Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}=\frac{1}{\mu _{0}}(\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B})\) now has two components: Axial Flux (\(S_{z}\)): Created by \(E_{r}\times B_{\phi }\). This is the power delivered to the load.Radial Flux (\(S_{r}\)): Created by \(E_{z}\times B_{\phi }\). Using \(\^{\mathbf{z}}\times \^{\phi }=-\^{\mathbf{r}}\):\(S_{r}=-\frac{1}{\mu _{0}}(E_{z}B_{\phi })=-\frac{1}{\mu _{0}}\left(\frac{\rho I}{\pi a^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\mu _{0}I}{2\pi a}\right)=-\frac{\rho I^{2}}{2\pi ^{2}a^{3}}\)The negative sign indicates energy flowing into the conductor to account for resistive loss. ➡️ Step 3: Calculate the Tilt Angle The tilt angle \(\theta \) is the angle between the Poynting vector and the axis of the cable. It is defined by the ratio of the field components:\(\tan (\theta )=\frac{|S_{r}|}{S_{z}}=\frac{E_{z}}{E_{r}}\)Using the expressions for \(E_{z}\) and \(E_{r}=\frac{V}{a\ln (b/a)}\):\(\theta \approx \arctan \left(\frac{\rho I}{\pi a^{2}}\cdot \frac{a\ln (b/a)}{V}\right)\)✅ Answer: The specific tilt angle is \(\theta =\arctan \left(\frac{\rho I\ln (b/a)}{\pi aV}\right)\). For copper (\(\rho \approx 1.68\times 10^{-8}\,\Omega \cdot m\)), this angle is typically extremely small (on the order of \(10^{-6}\) to \(10^{-8}\) radians), indicating that almost all energy is directed toward the load rather than being lost to heat.

Using standard specifications for an RG-58 coaxial cable, the tilt angle of the Poynting vector is approximately \(7.97\times 10^{-6}\) degrees. ➡️ Step 1: Define RG-58 Parameters To calculate a realistic value, we use the following standard data for an RG-58 cable: Inner Conductor Radius (\(a\)): \(0.405\,\text{mm}=0.405\times 10^{-3}\,\text{m}\) (solid 20 AWG copper).Outer Conductor Radius (\(b\)): \(1.475\,\text{mm}=1.475\times 10^{-3}\,\text{m}\).Copper Resistivity (\(\rho \)): \(1.68\times 10^{-8}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m}\). We assume a moderate operating state: Voltage (\(V\)): \(10\,\text{V}\).Current (\(I\)): \(0.1\,\text{A}\). ➡️ Step 2: Calculate Field Components Axial Electric Field (\(E_{z}\)): Driven by the resistance of the center conductor.\(E_{z}=\frac{\rho I}{\pi a^{2}}=\frac{(1.68\times 10^{-8})(0.1)}{\pi (0.405\times 10^{-3})^{2}}\approx 3.26\times 10^{-3}\,\text{V/m}\)Radial Electric Field (\(E_{r}\)): The main field transporting power.\(E_{r}=\frac{V}{a\ln (b/a)}=\frac{10}{(0.405\times 10^{-3})\ln (1.475/0.405)}\approx 19,100\,\text{V/m}\) ➡️ Step 3: Compute the Tilt Angle The tilt angle \(\theta \) is the angle between the total electric field (or Poynting vector) and the axis of the cable:\(\tan (\theta )=\frac{E_{z}}{E_{r}}\approx \frac{3.26\times 10^{-3}}{19,100}\approx 1.7\times 10^{-7}\)\(\theta =\arctan (1.7\times 10^{-7})\approx 1.7\times 10^{-7}\,\text{rad}\)Converting to degrees:\(\theta \approx 9.7\times 10^{-6}\,\text{degrees}\)✅ Answer: For a standard RG-58 cable carrying \(0.1\,\text{A}\) at \(10\,\text{V}\), the Poynting vector is tilted by roughly \(10^{-5}\) degrees toward the center conductor. This minuscule angle confirms that even in "lossy" real-world wires, the vast majority of energy flows parallel to the wire rather than into it. 

Increasing the current or switching to a high-resistance material increases the tilt angle \(\theta \) linearly. When you use Nichrome and a higher current, the angle increases from a negligible micro-degree to a visible fraction of a degree. ➡️ Step 1: Scaling with Resistivity (Nichrome) Nichrome has a resistivity \(\rho _{\text{ni}}\approx 1.1\times 10^{-6}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m}\), which is roughly 65 times higher than copper.Keeping the current at \(I=0.1\,\text{A}\) and voltage at \(V=10\,\text{V}\): \(E_{z}\) (Nichrome): \(\approx 0.213\,\text{V/m}\) (compared to \(0.00326\,\text{V/m}\) for copper).Ratio: The tilt angle factor \(\frac{E_{z}}{E_{r}}\) increases by a factor of 65.Result: \(\theta \approx 6.3\times 10^{-4}\,\text{degrees}\). ➡️ Step 2: Scaling with Current If we keep the material as Copper but increase the current from \(0.1\,\text{A}\) to \(10\,\text{A}\) (a 100-fold increase) while maintaining \(V=10\,\text{V}\): \(E_{z}\) (High Current): \(\approx 0.326\,\text{V/m}\).Ratio: \(\tan (\theta )\approx \frac{0.326}{19,100}\approx 1.7\times 10^{-5}\).Result: \(\theta \approx 9.7\times 10^{-4}\,\text{degrees}\). ➡️ Step 3: Combined Effect (Extreme Case) Using Nichrome at \(10\,\text{A}\) and \(10\,\text{V}\): \(E_{z}\): \(\approx 21.3\,\text{V/m}\).\(\tan (\theta )\): \(\frac{21.3}{19,100}\approx 1.1\times 10^{-3}\).Result: \(\theta \approx \mathbf{0.064}^{\mathbf{\circ }}\). ✅ Answer: The tilt angle increases linearly with both resistivity and current. By switching to Nichrome and increasing the current to \(10\,\text{A}\), the angle becomes \(0.064^{\circ }\). While still small, this is nearly 7,000 times larger than the angle in the original copper scenario, representing a significantly higher proportion of energy being "sucked" into the wire to compensate for heat losses.

At high frequencies, the current no longer flows through the entire cross-section of the wire but is confined to a thin layer near the surface, known as the skin depth (\(\delta \)). This significantly increases the axial electric field (\(E_{z}\)) and, consequently, the tilt angle of the Poynting vector. ➡️ Step 1: The Skin Effect and Surface Resistance As frequency (\(f\)) increases, the skin depth \(\delta \) is given by \(\delta =\sqrt{\frac{\rho }{\pi f\mu }}\). The surface resistance (\(R_{s}\)) represents the real part of the surface impedance and is defined as:\(R_{s}=\frac{\rho }{\delta }=\sqrt{\pi f\mu \rho }\)In this regime, the axial electric field at the surface of the conductor (\(r=a\)) is related to the surface current density by \(E_{z}=R_{s}\cdot K\), where \(K=\frac{I}{2\pi a}\). ➡️ Step 2: New Expression for \(E_{z}\) Substituting \(R_{s}\) into the expression for the axial field:\(E_{z}=\frac{IR_{s}}{2\pi a}=\frac{I}{2\pi a}\sqrt{\pi f\mu \rho }\)Notice that \(E_{z}\) now scales with the square root of frequency. At MHz or GHz frequencies, \(E_{z}\) becomes much larger than its DC counterpart. ➡️ Step 3: The High-Frequency Tilt Angle The tilt angle \(\theta \) remains \(\tan (\theta )=\frac{E_{z}}{E_{r}}\). Substituting the high-frequency values:\(\tan (\theta )=\frac{\frac{IR_{s}}{2\pi a}}{\frac{V}{a\ln (b/a)}}=\frac{IR_{s}\ln (b/a)}{2\pi V}\)Since \(V/I\) is the characteristic impedance of the line (\(Z_{0}\)) for a matched load, and \(Z_{0}=\frac{\eta }{2\pi }\ln (b/a)\) (where \(\eta \) is the intrinsic impedance of the dielectric), we can simplify the relationship:\(\tan (\theta )\approx \frac{R_{s}}{\eta }\)✅ Summary of the Shift Parameter DC / Low FrequencyHigh Frequency (Skin Effect)Resistance TypeBulk Resistance (\(R\))Surface Resistance (\(R_{s}\propto \sqrt{f}\))Field \(E_{z}\)Constant (for fixed \(I\))Increases with \(\sqrt{f}\)Tilt Angle \(\theta \)MinimalIncreases with frequencyFor a copper cable at 1 GHz, the surface resistance is roughly \(8.2\times 10^{-3}\,\Omega \). In a vacuum (\(\eta \approx 377\,\Omega \)), the tilt angle is approximately \(0.0012^{\circ }\). While still small, this is hundreds of times larger than the DC case, directly illustrating why high-frequency signals suffer much greater attenuation as the Poynting vector "veers" more sharply into the metal to be lost as heat.
