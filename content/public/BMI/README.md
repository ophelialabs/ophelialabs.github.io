# Comprehensive platforms
---
- [Neurodesk](https://neurodesk.org/): A platform that uses software containers for accessible, flexible, and reproducible analysis. It includes a browser-accessible virtual desktop and command-line interface.
- [BrainForge](https://brainforge.rs.gsu.edu/): A cloud-enabled, web-based platform for archiving, processing, and sharing neuroimaging data. It utilizes popular software like Nipype and FreeSurfer.
- [Neuroconductor](https://neuroconductor.org/): An open-source platform for neuroimaging analysis in the R environment. It functions similarly to Bioconductor, providing a central repository for R packages.
