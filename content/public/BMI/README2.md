Based on the principles of neural implants and wearable electronics, a Field-Effect Device (FED) or similar brain-machine interface (BMI) can cause irritation
due to a combination of mechanical friction, foreign body reactions, and localized skin sensitivity.

Why these specific areas are PRONE to irritation:

1. Behind the Ear: Pressure and Allergic Reaction
   The are behind the ear is often used for mounting external components of BCIs (similar to behind-the-ear hearing aids) or as an exit point for wires (percutaneous pedestals)
   - Faster Signal Transmission:
   - Decoding Accuracy:
   - Ground Electrode Placement:
   - Reference Point:
   - SpiralE:
   - Labeling Convention:
   - Positioning (E,J,H):
   - Sprial Config:
   - A2, M2, cEEGrid Layout:
Why the Right Ear Map is Unique
Allows the BCI to access the left hemisphere's lang and motor processing centers more efficiently. Less noise than cross-head
2. Apex (Top of the Head): Surgical Site and Material Mismatch
