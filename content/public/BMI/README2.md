Based on the principles of neural implants and wearable electronics, a Field-Effect Device (FED) or similar brain-machine interface (BMI) can cause irritation
due to a combination of mechanical friction, foreign body reactions, and localized skin sensitivity.

Why these specific areas are PRONE to irritation:
