Here is a simple, commented Blazor code example for creating a basic interactive element grid with a pop-up display, mimicking the functionality of a periodic table. 

This code uses Blazor's @onclick event handling and state management (changing selectedElement causes the UI to re-render, showing or hiding the modal) to create an interactive experience using pure C# logic.
