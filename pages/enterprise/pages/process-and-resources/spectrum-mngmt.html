Key Organizations
NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration): Manages federal government radio spectrum use.
FCC (Federal Communications Commission): Manages all non-federal (commercial, state, local) use in the U.S..
ITU (International Telecommunication Union): Coordinates global spectrum usage.
IRAC (Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee): Coordinates government spectrum use with the NTIA. 

Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)
The Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum management team consists of FCC-approved Spectrum Access System (SAS) administrators—Federated Wireless, Google, CommScope, Sony, Amdocs, and Key Bridge Wireless—that dynamically manage the 3550-3700 MHz band. They utilize Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) sensors to protect incumbent military radar and coordinate three-tiered access (Incumbent, Priority, General) to optimize, share, and prevent interference. 
Key Components of CBRS Management
Spectrum Access System (SAS): A centralized, automated, cloud-based database and frequency coordinator that manages radio access to the 3.5 GHz band, ensuring commercial devices (CBSDs) do not interfere with incumbents.
Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC): A network of sensors, often managed by SAS administrators, that detects U.S. Navy radar transmissions (incumbents) in real-time, feeding data to the SAS to instantly reallocate spectrum if necessary.
The Three Tiers of Access:
Incumbent Access: Federal users and authorized grandfathered fixed satellite services (highest priority).
Priority Access Licenses (PAL): Licensed commercial users with protected, 10 MHz channels.
General Authorized Access (GAA): Unlicensed, lowest-priority access, utilizing remaining capacity.
Regulatory Framework: Governed by the FCC under Part 96 rules, with technical standards developed by the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) and OnGo Alliance.

custom L, C, S bands
9 hours ago

"L, C, and S bands" refer to established frequency ranges within the electromagnetic spectrum, as defined by organizations like the IEEE, primarily used for radar, satellite communication, and increasingly, 5G networks. 
While the standard frequency ranges are fixed, the term "custom" can apply to a few aspects: 
Custom Equipment/Systems: Designing specific hardware (like antennas, filters, or transceivers) tuned to a specific frequency within these bands for a specialized application.
Custom Frequency Allocation: In some specialized or private network scenarios (e.g., military, specific industrial use, scientific research facilities like the VLA), specific frequencies within the broader band may be allocated for proprietary use, subject to regulatory approval. 
Standard Frequency Ranges
The generally accepted standard frequency ranges for these bands are:
L-band: 1 to 2 GHz (gigahertz)
Common uses: GNSS (GPS, GLONASS), satellite communication, aviation.
S-band: 2 to 4 GHz
Common uses: Weather radar, surface ship radar, satellite communication, and some 5G applications.
C-band: 4 to 8 GHz
Common uses: Satellite communication (uplink and downlink), terrestrial microwave links, and a significant portion of 5G mid-band spectrum (specifically 3.7 to 4.0 GHz in the US). 
Customization Potential
The "customization" you mention usually refers to engineering solutions for specific frequency needs, rather than changing the universal definition of the bands themselves. Examples include: 
Filter Design: Building custom electronic filters with specific inductance (L) and capacitance (C) values to pass a very narrow, specific slice of frequencies within, say, the C-band while blocking adjacent interference.
Antenna Tuning: Designing antennas optimized for peak performance at a non-standard center frequency within a given band (e.g., exactly 1.176 GHz for GPS L5 signal reception). 

the primary difference between 5G C-band and satellite C-band is how they have split the shared 3.7–4.2 GHz spectrum to prevent interference. 
Frequency Allocation
5G C-band: Occupies the lower portion of the band, specifically 3.7–3.98 GHz. Mobile carriers like Verizon and AT&T use this for high-speed "mid-band" 5G.
Satellite C-band: Historically used the entire 3.7–4.2 GHz range but has been "repacked" into the upper portion, specifically 4.0–4.2 GHz. It is used for satellite TV downlinks, weather monitoring, and data services.
Guard Band: A 20 MHz buffer (3.98–4.0 GHz) exists between the two to prevent 5G signals from bleeding into and overwhelming sensitive satellite receivers. 
Key Technical Differences
Feature 	5G C-band	Satellite C-band
Primary Use	Terrestrial mobile data (high speed/low latency)	Video broadcasting and remote communications
Signal Strength	High-power transmissions from local cell towers	Extremely weak signals traveling 36,000 km from space
Interference Risk	Potential to "blind" nearby satellite and aviation equipment	Susceptible to saturation from ground-based 5G towers
Hardware	Integrated into smartphones and cell towers	Requires satellite dishes and specialized Low-Noise Block (LNB) receivers
Why This Matters
The shift occurred because 5G needs the wide "lanes" found in C-band to deliver speeds up to 1 Gbps, which older, lower frequency bands cannot support. However, because 5G operates right next to frequencies used by aircraft radio altimeters (4.2–4.4 GHz), the FAA has mandated strict safety measures to ensure 5G towers don't interfere with critical landing equipment. 

Custom VHF A-bands refer to specialized or tuned radio frequency antennas, typically in the 30-300 MHz range, optimized for specific applications like marine, aviation, or land-based systems. These antennas are often tuned to a precise center frequency (e.g., 122-300 MHz for aircraft or 144-175 MHz for 2-meter ham) to maximize gain (often 3-10 dB) and minimize VSWR. Marine & AIS: Custom-tuned antennas are available for VHF marine radio (156 MHz) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) frequencies (162 MHz), with options for high-gain 6dB or 10dB performance.Aviation (Airband): Custom antennas for aircraft communication, such as 122 MHz, are designed for specialized airband use.Ham/Amateur Radio: Custom 5/8 wave mobile or base station antennas are tuned for the 2-meter band (144–148 MHz).Commercial & Specialized: Wideband VHF antennas (134–176 MHz) or specialized low-band (25-54 MHz) antennas are engineered for specific government or commercial applications.Customization: Vendors like Morad and DPD Productions provide antennas that can be built to a specific center frequency with a narrow bandwidth (e.g., \(\pm 5\text{MHz}\)) for optimal performance, ensuring a low VSWR.Vehicle/Marine Mounting: Options include low-profile, ruggedized, and high-gain antennas suitable for vehicles, trailers, and boats. These customized solutions ensure maximum signal strength and range.

Custom VHF "Band A" solutions typically involve specialized antennas and filtering hardware designed for specific frequency ranges within the Very High Frequency spectrum (30–300 MHz). While "Band A" often refers to lower frequencies (30–50 MHz) or aircraft bands (108–137 MHz), custom tuning allows equipment to be optimized for precise center frequencies to improve gain and signal clarity. 
Custom-Tuned Antennas
For technical projects involving specific frequencies, custom-tuned antennas provide superior performance by minimizing the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) at your target frequency. 

Filtering and Signal Conditioning
To prevent interference, especially when using Software Defined Radios (SDRs) in high-density environments, custom bandpass filters are essential for isolating the desired "Band A" signals. 

ERI Low Band VHF Band Pass Filters
These high-power filters (up to 25 kW) are designed for low-band applications like TV broadcasting, featuring temperature-compensated designs to maintain frequency stability.

Advanced Transceivers
High-performance transceivers offer wide-band monitoring and the ability to tune into specific custom channels within the VHF range. 

DIY & Experimental Projects
Given your interest in SDRs, development kits, and spectrum management, you might find these technical components useful for building custom VHF monitoring stations:
SDR-Optimized Preamps: Using a LNAU Custom Filter can significantly improve your experience with platforms like the RTL-SDR by narrowing the front-end filter to your specific band of interest, such as the 30–50 MHz range.
3D Printed Antenna Mounts: Your experience with Creality and Prusa 3D printers can be applied to creating custom, weather-resistant enclosures for VHF filters or specialized mounts for "Hot Rod" style antennas like the AEP Sales 156HD.
ESP32 Integration: For remote spectrum monitoring, you can integrate VHF receiver modules with your ESP32 development boards to create low-power, networked frequency loggers for "Band A" activity.
