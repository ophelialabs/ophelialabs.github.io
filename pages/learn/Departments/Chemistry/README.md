## [InQuanto](https://www.quantinuum.com/products-solutions/inquanto#)
InQuanto is a high-performance quantum computation chemistry software platform developed by Quantinuum. It is designed to help chemists and materials scientists transition work from classical simulations to quantum computes. 

## Key Capabilities
- Platform Flexibility: Built on the TKET SDK, it allows users to run expdriments on diverse hardware, including Quantinuum's H-series, IBM's superconducting systems, and AWS Braket. 
- Advanced Algoriths: Provides a suite of state-of-the-art algoriths (like VQE and VQD) and noise mitigation techniques tailored for today's "Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum" (NISQ) devices.
- Classical Integration: Includes extensions like InQuanto-PySCF to interface with classical chemistry packages, enabling "fragmentation" of large molecular systems into smaller parts that quantum hardware can handle.
- GPU Acceleration: Recent versions integrate NVIDIA cuQuantum to use GPUs for faster classical simulation of quantum circuits.

## Applications
Industry leaders like BMW, Honeywell, JSR, Nippon Steel, and TotalEnergies use the platform to explore breakthroughs in:
- Drug Discovery: Modeling complex protein-ligand interactions.
- Material Design: Developing next-generation batteries and catalysts.
- Energy: Simulating chemical processes for carbon capture or fuel efficiency.
