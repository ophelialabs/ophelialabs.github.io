# Passive Photon Observation in Magnetic Fields

## Summary
Overview of non‑destructive (QND) optical techniques to monitor light in magnetic environments: Faraday rotation, Cotton–Mouton, dispersive/off‑resonant probes, and practical benchtop tips.

## Goal
Measure phase/polarization changes induced by magnetic fields without absorbing photons.

## Key Concepts
- QND (Quantum Non‑Demolition): measure conserved observables (phase/number) without destroying photons.  
- Faraday Effect: rotation ∝ B (longitudinal).  
- Cotton–Mouton: induced ellipticity ∝ B² (transverse).  
- Off‑resonant probing: detune probe to avoid excitation.

## Typical Bench Setup
- Stabilized low‑power laser (HeNe or diode)  
- High‑extinction polarizer / analyzer (Glan prisms)  
- Magnet assembly (static or rotating) and magnetic medium (5CB, MBBA, nitrobenzene, Rb vapor)  
- Polarimeter/interferometer + lock‑in amplifier synchronized to magnet modulation

## Measurement Strategies
- Faraday rotation (measure polarization angle).  
- Cotton–Mouton (measure induced ellipticity with crossed polars and QWP).  
- Dispersive cavity/QND: infer presence via phase shifts of an off‑resonant probe.  
- Lock‑in or synchronous detection keyed to rotation or modulation frequency.

## Practical Tips
- Use high extinction optics and vacuum or enclosed cells to reduce turbulence.  
- For vapors (Rb): heat and detune by GHz to avoid absorption.  
- Use differential detection and pilot/reference channels to reduce technical noise.

## Safety & Materials
- Nitrobenzene and CS2 are toxic—use sealed cuvettes and fume control.  
- High magnetic fields and rotating magnets need mechanical guards and interlocks.

## Next Steps / References
- Start with liquid crystals (5CB) in a thin cell and a lock‑in referenced to the magnet RPM.  
- For vacuum/QED tests, review PVLAS literature and consider scaled expectations (very large B required).
