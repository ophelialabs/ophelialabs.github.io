Advanced materials manipulate UV light through various methods, including nanostructuring materials like bismuth or AlN to control its generation and path, and embedding additives into polymers to absorb, block, or stabilize against UV radiation. Other techniques involve using materials like sapphire with patterned surfaces to guide light emission, and specialized devices such as spatial light modulators with nanostructured aluminum mirrors to alter the phase and intensity of UV light. 
Nanostructured materials
Controlling generation: Nanostructuring materials like bismuth and silica can enable direct manipulation of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) light at its source. This allows for flexible control over the emission characteristics that are difficult to achieve with conventional optics, which are often absorbed by EUV light.
AlN epilayers: Materials like aluminum nitride (AlN) can be grown on nanostructured substrates like sapphire to control strain and crystal quality, which in turn affects the material's interaction with light.
Metamaterials: Bismuth-based metamaterials can exhibit unique responses in the UV-visible range, allowing for manipulation of light through both static design and dynamic control, such as the solid-liquid transition of bismuth. 
Polymer additives
Stabilizers: Additives like hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) can neutralize free radicals caused by UV exposure to prevent polymer breakdown.
Absorbers: Chemicals such as benzophenones and benzotriazoles absorb UV radiation and convert it to heat, reducing damage to the material.
Blockers: Materials like titanium oxide and carbon black can be added to block UV rays from penetrating the material. 
Specialized devices
Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs): An array of micro-mirrors can be used to alter the phase and intensity of UV light, creating specific patterns by reflecting and interfering the light.
DUV LEDs: Deep ultraviolet (DUV) light sources, such as AlGaN-based LEDs, are used for applications like disinfection, but their efficiency can be improved by manipulating the nitride quantum structures through various physical fields.

The efficiency of deep UV (DUV) LEDs is limited by several significant material and design challenges, primarily stemming from the use of high aluminum (Al) content in the AlGaN semiconductor materials required to achieve shorter wavelengths. Key challenges include: 1. Poor Material Quality and High Defect Density The performance of DUV LEDs is highly sensitive to the crystal quality of the AlGaN layers. Lattice Mismatch: AlGaN layers are typically grown on sapphire substrates, which have a large lattice and thermal expansion coefficient mismatch with AlGaN. This results in high threading dislocation densities (TDDs), often in the range of \(10^{10}\) cm⁻², which act as non-radiative recombination centers, significantly reducing the internal quantum efficiency (IQE).Crystal Growth Difficulties: The high Al content needed for shorter wavelengths requires high growth temperatures and affects the surface mobility of Al atoms, leading to more point defects and dislocations compared to the more mature blue LED (InGaN) technology. 2. Inefficient Doping and Carrier Injection Achieving high conductivity in both n-type and p-type AlGaN layers is difficult, leading to poor carrier injection efficiency (CIE) and high operating voltages. P-type Doping Issues: The most significant problem is the difficulty in achieving sufficient hole concentration in p-type AlGaN layers. The activation energy of magnesium (Mg), the common p-type dopant, increases dramatically with higher Al content, making it difficult to generate enough free holes at room temperature.Electron Leakage: Due to low hole concentrations, many electrons overflow from the active region into the p-type layers without recombining radiatively, further reducing efficiency.Ohmic Contact Formation: Realizing low-resistance ohmic contacts, especially to the p-type layer, is challenging and contributes to higher power consumption and heat generation. 3. Low Light Extraction Efficiency (LEE) Even if photons are generated efficiently, extracting them from the device is a major hurdle. Internal Absorption: The commonly used p-GaN contact layers strongly absorb DUV light, which means much of the generated light is lost before it can exit the chip.Optical Polarization Anisotropy: In high-Al-content AlGaN alloys, the emitted light tends to be polarized in the transverse magnetic (TM) mode, which is largely guided horizontally within the device structure and easily trapped due to total internal reflection, rather than being emitted vertically.Reflectivity Issues: Low reflectivity of standard electrodes and packaging materials in the DUV range means a large fraction of light is absorbed internally. 4. Thermal Management and Reliability The low electrical conductivity of AlGaN and the various non-radiative recombination processes generate significant heat. Heat Dissipation: Sapphire substrates have relatively low thermal conductivity, making heat dissipation difficult. This increased junction temperature further decreases the radiative recombination rate and accelerates the degradation and aging of device components and packaging materials (which can yellow under intense UV irradiation), shortening the LED's lifespan.  Creating a public link...Can’t create link.
