## Overview: Redundancy and Monitoring

Systems like SmartTerminal™ provide hardened control environments to monitor multiple sites and antennas, ensuring secure protocols are maintained even if a traditional control room is bypassed.

In the context of the QEYSSat mission and its associated infrastructure, SmartTerminal refers to an integrated control and monitoring platform designed to manage complex satellite and drone ground stations.

### Redundancy in the OQGS

The Optical Quantum Ground Station (OQGS) achieves mission-critical reliability through multiple redundant layers:

- **Geographic Redundancy**: The primary station at St-Hubert (CSA) is supported by a transportable station and the IQC station in Waterloo. This allows the mission to "hand off" tasks if weather or hardware fails at one site.
- **Hot Redundancy**: Control systems use a "hot redundant" configuration where primary and backup servers synchronize in real-time. If the primary fails, the backup takes over automatically to prevent data loss.
- **Physical Infrastructure**: Critical components like power supplies, network switches, and fiber loops are duplicated to ensure 24/7 connectivity even during local utility outages.

### Monitoring with SmartTerminal Platforms

Modern ground station monitoring platforms, such as those within the Honeywell ecosystem, provide comprehensive oversight:

- **Unified Control Hub**: They act as a centralized "cockpit" to monitor telemetry, link health, and payload status across multiple sites.
- **Automated Failsafes**: The software continuously monitors Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and environmental sensors (such as wind and humidity). If parameters exceed safe limits, it triggers automated shutdowns of the telescope dome.
- **Mission Orchestration**: These platforms allow for advanced "Beyond Visual Line of Sight" (BVLOS) operations, providing real-time situational awareness and the ability to manage multiple tracking assets simultaneously.
- **Diagnostic Logs**: Extensive logging modules systematically archive performance data (QBER, tracking jitter) for post-pass scientific analysis by the Science Operation Centre (SOC).

## U-space Integration and Regulatory Standards

The integration of U-space services and rigorous regulatory standards ensures that advanced terminals like Honeywell's SmartTerminal can safely manage the complex, often remote, operations of quantum and autonomous systems.

### 1. U-space Integration for Terminals

U-space is a highly digitized air traffic management (ATM) environment designed to safely integrate a high volume of uncrewed systems into shared airspace. Honeywell's Ground Control Station (GCS)—a primary component of its smart terminal ecosystem—integrates these services to enable Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations.

- **Tactical Deconfliction**: Integrated U-space services allow terminals to perform tactical conflict detection and automated mission conformance monitoring, preventing collisions with other crewed or uncrewed aircraft in real-time.
- **Dynamic Mission Orchestration**: These terminals can automatically divert unmanned aircraft during unexpected situations, such as airspace emergencies or loss of communication links.
- **Inter-Station Handover**: Future enhancements for these terminals include the seamless handover of control between different ground stations and the management of multiple assets by a single operator.
- **Ground-Based Detect and Avoid**: Modern terminals demonstrate implementations of ground-based safety tools to ensure reliable flight even in uncontrolled airspaces.

### 2. Regulatory Standards for Remote Ground Stations

The operation of remote stations in Canada, such as the OQGS in St-Hubert or transportable units, is governed by several critical federal acts and international guidelines:

**Spectrum and Site Approval**:
- Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) Canada issues spectrum licenses for earth stations. Operators must meet specific transmit/receive contour limits—typically a radius of less than 30 km—to avoid encumbering other fixed or mobile services.

**Remote Sensing Space Systems Act (RSSSA)**:
- Any ground station operating as part of a remote sensing system (even if for scientific QKD) must be licensed by Global Affairs Canada (GAC). This includes strict plans for:
  - Physical Security: Protecting hardware and facilities from unauthorized access.
  - Information Assurance: Safeguarding raw data transfers between remote facilities.
  - Personnel Screening: Security checks for all operators involved in data handling.
  - Space Debris Mitigation: Ground station licenses often require the applicant to submit a satellite de-orbiting plan compliant with UNOOSA and IADC international guidelines to ensure long-term orbital sustainability.

**Remote Autonomy Standards**:
- Stations operating fully remotely must demonstrate automated capabilities for telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) while maintaining a 99% or higher success rate for satellite passes.

## BVLOS Safety Frameworks

Safety toolsets for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) flight path planning integrate risk assessment frameworks, real-time sensing hardware, and mission orchestration software to ensure operations remain within regulatory and safety limits.

### 1. Risk Assessment and Compliance Frameworks

Before a flight begins, planning relies on structured methodologies to categorize and mitigate potential hazards.

- **Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA)**: The "gold standard" for complex missions. It evaluates Ground Risk Class (GRC) (harm to people/property) and Air Risk Class (ARC) (mid-air collisions) to determine a Specific Assurance and Integrity Level (SAIL).
- **Flight Risk Assessment Tools (FRAT)**: Visual tools used by pilots to proactively identify hazards and make go/no-go decisions before takeoff.
- **Mission Planning Software**: Platforms like UgCS, DroneDeploy, and DJI Pilot 2 automate flight paths, integrate real-time data feeds, and include robust compliance features for professional workflows.

### 2. Real-Time Detect and Avoid (DAA) Hardware

Onboard sensors act as the "eyes" of the aircraft when it is out of the pilot's sight.

- **IntuVue RDR-84K Radar**: A Honeywell system that integrates traffic avoidance, obstacle detection, and terrain mapping using built-in circuitry to compute avoidance paths autonomously.
- **ADS-B In/Out**: A transponder-based system that broadcasts the drone's position and speed while receiving data from other nearby aircraft.
- **Vision-Based Systems**: Onboard AI-powered engines, such as Nexys, use Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles like people or wires in real-time.

### 3. Connectivity and Redundancy Systems

Safe BVLOS requires uninterrupted communication to maintain control and receive safety updates.

- **Bonded Connectivity**: Solutions like Elsight Halo bond multiple networks (cellular, satellite, and RF) into a single secure link with automated failover to ensure continuous data streaming.
- **Satellite Communications (SATCOM)**: Systems like the Honeywell Small UAV SATCOM enable two-way data transmission and real-time video over global satellite networks, essential for remote or over-water missions.
- **Redundant Navigation**: High-precision Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and multiple GNSS systems keep drones on course even if GPS signals are lost or degraded.

### 4. Ground-Based Orchestration

Advanced ground control stations (GCS) evolve from simple piloting platforms into full mission orchestration systems.

- **Honeywell GCS**: Designed for large drones, it manages autonomous navigation and hazard avoidance while the operator monitors for regulatory compliance and operational safety.
- **Synthetic Vision**: Systems like SmartView generate a 3D rendering of forward terrain from onboard databases and GPS, providing pilots with a clear "daylight" view even in fog or low-visibility conditions.

## Core Infrastructure and Hardware

The OQGS utilizes advanced optical systems to maintain precise alignment with the satellite moving at high speeds. According to SpaceOps-2025, the station's construction includes:

- **Telescope and Mount**: A 43 cm aperture telescope equipped with a beacon emitter for automated tracking.
- **Quantum Sources**: Integrated systems for generating an Entangled Photon Source (EPS) and Weak Coherent Pulse (WCP) transmissions.
- **Protective Dome**: A specialized structure designed to open/close for operations and automatically shut down during rapid weather changes to protect sensitive optics.
- **Back-end Assembly**: Includes pointing, tracking, and polarization control to ensure the quantum state of the photons remains intact during atmospheric transit.

### Locations and Deployment

The mission incorporates a primary station and several collaborative sites to ensure operational flexibility, especially if local weather conditions are poor.

- **Primary OQGS**: To be located at the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) headquarters in St-Hubert (Longueuil), Quebec, with deployment completion targeted for late 2025.
- **Science Operation Centre (SOC)**: Managed by the University of Waterloo (IQC), which also hosts its own quantum ground station for research and mission support.
- **Transportable Option**: Honeywell has also developed a Transportable Optical Ground Station (TOGS) designed to be compatible with QEYSSat, featuring a larger 61 cm receiver and ruggedized for Canadian winters.

### Key Mission Functions

- **Uplink Demonstration**: Unlike many other missions, QEYSSat focuses on a ground-to-space uplink, where the ground station generates the quantum signal and the satellite acts as the receiver.
- **Hybrid Communication**: The OQGS is designed to demonstrate full-duplex classical optical communication alongside its quantum functions.
- **Night-time Operations**: To prevent stray light from interfering with sensitive single-photon detection, most quantum experiments must take place during eclipse periods at night.
- **Data Analysis**: The station records polarization states, timestamps, and error rates for post-pass scientific analysis.

## Hardware Breakdown

The hardware for the QEYSSat Optical Quantum Ground Station (OQGS) is a sophisticated blend of high-precision astronomical equipment and cutting-edge quantum optics. Because the mission utilizes an uplink (sending photons from the ground to a satellite), the hardware must compensate for atmospheric turbulence before the signal even leaves the Earth's orbit.

### 1. The Optical Assembly (Telescope & Tracking)

The "front end" of the OQGS is responsible for finding the satellite and maintaining a stable link.

- **The Telescope**: A 43 cm (17-inch) PlaneWave CDK17 corrected Dall-Kirkham telescope. It is chosen for its flat field and lack of coma, which is essential for maintaining photon polarization.
- **The Mount**: A direct-drive equatorial mount (often the PlaneWave L-500). Unlike gear-driven mounts, direct-drive systems allow for high-speed, vibration-free tracking required to follow a satellite moving at ~7.5 km/s in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
- **Beacon Laser**: A high-power 808 nm (near-infrared) laser used as a "handshake" signal. The satellite looks for this beacon to orient itself, while the ground station uses the satellite's beacon to perform closed-loop tracking.

### 2. The Quantum Source System

Located in the "Coudé room" or a temperature-controlled laboratory beneath the telescope, this hardware generates the actual quantum states.

- **Weak Coherent Pulse (WCP) Source**: Uses high-speed Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) or diode lasers at 785 nm. These are attenuated to the single-photon level using neutral density filters to simulate a quantum signal.
- **Entangled Photon Source (EPS)**: Uses Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). A pump laser hits a non-linear crystal (like periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate, or ppKTP) to create a pair of entangled photons. One is measured locally; the other is sent to the telescope.
- **Quantum Pulse Position Modulation (QPPM)**: Specialized electronics that timing-encode the pulses with sub-nanosecond precision.

### 3. Polarization and Timing Control

Since the quantum information is encoded in the polarization of the photons (e.g., horizontal, vertical, diagonal), the hardware must "undo" any changes caused by the atmosphere or the telescope's mirrors.

- **Liquid Crystal Variable Retarders (LCVRs)**: These are used for high-speed, non-mechanical polarization compensation. They adjust the phase of the light in real-time to ensure the satellite receives the correct "state."
- **GPS-Disciplined Rubidium Clocks**: Essential for time-tagging. Both the ground station and the satellite must be synchronized within nanoseconds to ensure that the photon detected by the satellite is the exact same one sent by the ground station.

### 4. Atmospheric and Support Systems

- **Hatch/Dome Automation**: The station is housed in a clamshell dome that is integrated with a weather station. If sensors detect high humidity, precipitation, or high winds, the dome closes automatically to protect the optics.
- **Classical Optical Link**: A separate transceiver for 1550 nm (standard telecom wavelength) communication. This is used for the "public" part of the QKD protocol, such as error correction and privacy amplification.

### Hardware Summary

| Component | Specification / Model | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Telescope | 43 cm PlaneWave CDK | Photon transmission & tracking |
| Quantum Wavelength | ~785 nm | Optimal for Si-based detectors on satellite |
| Beacon Wavelength | 808 nm | Tracking and pointing handshake |
| Clock Precision | Rubidium Standard | Nanosecond event synchronization |
| Correction Hardware | LCVRs | Real-time polarization alignment |

## Polarization Compensation and Software Management

Polarization compensation and software management are the critical "brains" of the QEYSSat mission, ensuring that quantum information remains readable despite atmospheric distortion and satellite movement.

### 1. Polarization Compensation Mechanism

Because QEYSSat primarily uses an uplink (ground-to-satellite), the ground station must "pre-compensate" the photons so they arrive at the satellite in the correct orientation.

- **Dynamic Reference Frame Alignment**: As the satellite moves across the sky, its relative orientation to the ground station changes. To correct this, the OQGS uses Liquid Crystal Variable Retarders (LCVRs)—non-mechanical cells that change their optical properties when a specific voltage is applied.
- **The Beacon Handshake**: The satellite and ground station exchange linearly polarized beacon lasers (808 nm). By measuring the polarization of the incoming satellite beacon, the OQGS calculates the exact rotation and ellipticity shifts currently affecting the link.
- **Real-Time Correction Loop**: The system feeds these calculations into a control algorithm that adjusts the LCVRs in real-time. This maintains a high Polarization Extinction Ratio (PER), typically targeting a fidelity of over 99.5%, which is necessary to keep the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) low enough for key generation.

### 2. Software Protocols and Key Exchange

The QEYSSat mission utilizes the BB84 protocol (for weak coherent pulses) and the BBM92 protocol (for entangled photons) to manage the key exchange.

**Post-Processing Protocol Layers**:

- **Sifting**: After a satellite pass, the ground station and satellite compare their measurement bases (but not the actual bit values) over a classical channel. Bits where the bases did not match are discarded.
- **Error Correction**: Algorithms identify and fix discrepancies caused by atmospheric noise or equipment jitter.
- **Photon Jitter**: Modern researchers associated with Searl's lineage have studied quantum-limited timing jitter in fiber lasers, which involves observing the noise performance and stability of single-photon pulses.
- **Privacy Amplification**: This final step shrinks the final key to ensure that even if an eavesdropper intercepted some information, they have zero usable knowledge of the final resulting key.

**Key Management System (KMS)**:
- The mission is designed to integrate with Honeywell's EvolutionQ key management software. This software handles the storage and distribution of the completed keys to end-users once the "raw" quantum data has been fully processed into a secure symmetric key.

**Trusted Node Configuration**:
- Since the satellite acts as a receiver for multiple ground stations (e.g., St-Hubert and Waterloo), it can act as a trusted node. It generates a Boolean combination (XOR) of two different keys from two locations and broadcasts the result, allowing the two ground stations to establish a shared key without the satellite ever permanently storing the full final secret.

## Science Operation Centre (SOC)

The Science Operation Centre (SOC) at the University of Waterloo (Institute for Quantum Computing) serves as the mission's analytical hub. While Honeywell handles the satellite's industrial infrastructure, the SOC is where the raw physics data is transformed into validated quantum science.

### 1. The Role of the Science Operation Centre (SOC)

The SOC manages the "life cycle" of the quantum data, which is significantly more complex than standard satellite telemetry.

**Mission Planning & Scheduling**:
- The SOC calculates "pass opportunities." Because QKD requires specific atmospheric conditions (low cloud cover, low background light), the SOC coordinates with weather services to decide which ground station (St-Hubert vs. Waterloo) will perform the uplink during a specific orbital window.

**Time-Tag Correlation**:
- The satellite and ground station both generate massive files of "time-tags" (nanosecond-precise logs of when a photon was sent or detected). The SOC runs high-performance algorithms to synchronize these two clocks and identify matching photon pairs across thousands of kilometers.

**Performance Characterization**:
- The SOC analyzes the QBER (Quantum Bit Error Rate) to distinguish between different types of noise:
  - Dark Counts: Internal detector noise.
  - Background Noise: Stray light from the moon or cities.
  - Alignment Errors: Tracking jitters or polarization drift.

**Validation of Quantum Advantage**:
- They verify that the keys produced are truly random and meet the statistical requirements for cryptographic security.

### 2. Security Proofs: BB84 with Decoy States

The original BB84 protocol has a vulnerability: a sophisticated eavesdropper (Eve) could use a Photon Number Splitting (PNS) attack. Since the OQGS uses "weak coherent pulses" (lasers dimmed down), some pulses accidentally contain two or three photons instead of just one. Eve could steal one photon and let the other go to the satellite, gaining information without being detected.

To prevent this, QEYSSat uses the Decoy-State Protocol.

**How it works**:
- The ground station sends pulses at different intensities, randomly interleaved:
  - **Signal States**: The primary pulses used for key generation (averaging μ ≈ 0.5 photons).
  - **Decoy States**: Pulses with a different average intensity (e.g., ν ≈ 0.1 photons).
  - **Vacuum States**: Pulses with zero intensity to measure background noise.

**The Proof Logic**:
- The security proof relies on the fact that an eavesdropper cannot know whether a specific pulse is a "Signal" or a "Decoy" state.

**Linear Programming**:
- By comparing the detection rates of the Signal states versus the Decoy states at the satellite, the SOC can mathematically calculate the upper bound of how much information an eavesdropper could have intercepted.

**Secret Key Rate**:
- The final secure key length (R) is calculated using a formula derived from the decoy-state analysis:

$$R \geq q\{Q_1[1-H(e_1)] - Q_\mu f(E_\mu)H(E_\mu)\}$$

Where:
- $Q_1$: Yield of single-photon pulses.
- $e_1$: Estimated error rate of single photons.
- $f(E_\mu)$: Error correction efficiency.
- $H$: Shannon entropy.

If the math shows that the "leakage" to an eavesdropper is too high, the system aborts the key generation for that pass.

### 3. Comparison of Key Exchange Protocols

| Protocol | Hardware Source | Security Basis |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| BB84 (Decoy) | Attenuated Laser (WCP) | No-cloning theorem + Decoy analysis |
| BBM92 | Entangled Pairs (EPS) | Bell's Theorem / Violation of CHSH inequality |

## Bell Test and Atmospheric Modeling

To verify that the quantum link is truly "quantum" and secure against any classical manipulation, the Science Operation Centre (SOC) performs a Bell Test.

### 1. The Bell Test (CHSH Inequality)

The SOC uses a specific version of the Bell Test known as the CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) inequality. This is the mathematical "gold standard" for proving entanglement.

**The Setup**:
- The Entangled Photon Source (EPS) at the ground station produces pairs of photons in a "Bell State" (usually the $|\psi^+\rangle$ or $|\phi^+\rangle$ state). One photon is measured locally at the ground station, and the other is beamed to QEYSSat.

**The Procedure**:
- **Basis Rotation**: The ground station and the satellite randomly choose between two measurement bases (angles). For a CHSH test, these are typically set at 0°, 45° for the ground and 22.5°, 67.5° for the satellite.
- **Correlation Calculation**: The SOC collects the results and calculates the correlation coefficient $E(a,b)$ for each combination of angles.
- **The S-Value**: These correlations are plugged into the CHSH formula:

$$S = |E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b')|$$

**The Threshold**:
- If $S \leq 2$: The correlations can be explained by classical physics (no entanglement).
- If $2 < S \leq 2\sqrt{2}$: The system is entangled.

**Why it matters for Security**:
- If the SOC measures an S-value significantly greater than 2, it proves that the photons have not been measured or tampered with by an eavesdropper (Eve). Any "eavesdropping" would collapse the entanglement and push the S-value back toward 2.

### 2. Atmospheric Modeling

Since QEYSSat uses an uplink, the photons must travel through the densest part of the atmosphere (the troposphere) immediately after leaving the telescope. The SOC models three major atmospheric challenges:

**A. Scintillation and Beam Wander**

- **Turbulence Effect**: Turbulence in the air acts like tiny moving lenses. This causes the beam to "jitter" (beam wander) and fluctuate in intensity (scintillation).
- **The Model**: The SOC uses the Log-Normal distribution to model these fluctuations.
- **The Impact**: If the beam wanders off the satellite's small aperture, increasing loss occurs. The SOC uses the model to optimize the divergence angle of the transmitter to balance between a tight beam (high power) and a wide beam (easier to hit the target).

**B. Polarization Turbulence (The "Hufnagel-Valley" Model)**

- **Theory**: The SOC uses the Hufnagel-Valley (HV) model to characterize the refractive index structure ($C_n^2$) of the atmosphere at different altitudes.
- **Role**: While the atmosphere generally preserves polarization well, stress in the telescope mirrors and rapidly changing air density can cause "depolarization."
- **Compensation**: The model helps the SOC predict the required speed for the LCVRs (Liquid Crystal Variable Retarders) to counteract these shifts during a 5–10 minute pass.

**C. Background Radiance and Transmittance**

- The SOC runs simulations using MODTRAN (Moderate Resolution Atmospheric Transmission) to predict:
  - **Transmittance**: How many photons are absorbed or scattered by aerosols and water vapor.
  - **Sky Noise**: The amount of background light (lunar or urban) that might "drown out" the quantum signal. This determines the required spectral filtering (narrowband filters) used on the satellite.

### 3. Summary of SOC Analytical Flow

| Step | Action | Tool/Theory |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Pre-Pass | Predict link feasibility | MODTRAN / HV Model |
| During Pass | Active Tracking & Correction | LCVR Control / Beacon Feedback |
| Post-Pass | Synchronize Photons | Cross-Correlation Algorithms |
| Security Check | Verify Entanglement | CHSH Inequality (S > 2) |
| Key Generation | Final Secure Key | Privacy Amplification |

## Optical Alignment and Time-Tagging

To achieve a successful quantum link, the OQGS must solve two physical challenges: perfectly aligning the photon's path through a moving telescope (Coudé Path) and perfectly aligning the "clocks" of two platforms moving at 7.5 km/s (Time-Tagging).

### 1. The Coudé Path: Keeping the Light "Still"

In a standard telescope, the camera sits on the back and moves with the tube. For QEYSSat, the quantum source is too bulky and sensitive to move. The Coudé Path (from the French for "elbow") uses a series of mirrors to redirect light from the moving telescope down into a stationary laboratory.

**Mirror Geometry**:
- The light travels from the primary mirror to the secondary, then hits a tertiary mirror at the intersection of the altitude and azimuth axes. No matter where the telescope points, the beam is reflected down a hollow "pier" into the stable room below.

**The Polarization Challenge**:
- Every time a photon hits a mirror at an angle, its polarization changes. In a Coudé path, these angles change as the telescope tracks the satellite.

**The Hardware Solution**:
- The OQGS uses a "Polarization Compensator" consisting of the LCVRs mentioned earlier.

**The Alignment Logic**:
- The system must account for the dihedral angle change. Software calculates the geometric rotation based on the telescope's current Altitude and Azimuth coordinates and applies an inverse transformation to the photons before they ever enter the telescope.

**Cleanroom Environment**:
- The path is often shrouded in tubes filled with filtered, dry air to prevent "beam jitter" caused by internal air currents (thermal blooms) inside the telescope structure.

### 2. Time-Tagging Algorithms

The satellite and the ground station each have their own "stopwatch" (Rubidium atomic clocks). Even with high precision, these clocks drift relative to each other, and the "travel time" of the photons changes as the satellite moves closer or further away.

**A. The Raw Data**:
- Each detection event is recorded as a Time-Tag: a digital packet containing the detector ID and a timestamp (typically with ps (picosecond) resolution).

**B. The Synchronization Algorithm (The "Cross-Correlation" Method)**:
- The SOC cannot simply use GPS time because it isn't precise enough for quantum pulse intervals. Instead, they use the data itself to sync:
  - **Coarse Sync**: The SOC uses the classical beacon signal or GPS timestamps to get the clocks within a few milliseconds of each other.
  - **Doppler Compensation**: The software calculates the Range Rate. As the satellite approaches, the pulses arrive faster (blueshifted timing); as it recedes, they arrive slower. The algorithm "stretches" or "shrinks" the time-axis of the data to compensate for this.
  - **Fine Sync (Cross-Correlation)**: The algorithm performs a "Sliding Window" cross-correlation. It takes a chunk of ground timestamps and "slides" it over the satellite timestamps looking for a statistical peak where the number of coincidences (matches) spikes.
  - **The "Peak" Recovery**: Once the peak is found, the SOC knows the exact offset. Any detection falling within a narrow coincidence window (e.g., 1–2 nanoseconds) is considered a "valid" quantum bit; everything else is discarded as noise.

**C. The Mathematical Formula for Peak Detection**:
- In quantum time-tagging, we don't have a continuous signal, but a series of discrete "clicks." The SOC uses a Discrete Cross-Correlation function to find the time offset ($\tau$) between the ground clock ($T_g$) and the satellite clock ($T_s$). If $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ represent the time-tag sequences as a series of Dirac delta functions, the correlation $G(\tau)$ is expressed as:

$$G(\tau) = \sum_i \sum_j W(t_{g,i} - t_{s,j} - \tau)$$

Where:
- $t_{g,i}$ is the i-th timestamp at the ground station.
- $t_{s,j}$ is the j-th timestamp at the satellite.
- $W(\Delta t)$ is a window function (usually a rectangular pulse or Gaussian) that equals 1 if $|\Delta t| < w/2$ and 0 otherwise, where w is the coincidence window width (e.g., 500 ps).

The SOC looks for the value of $\tau$ that maximizes $G(\tau)$. This maximum represents the Total Time of Flight plus the relative Clock Bias. Because the satellite is moving, $\tau$ is actually a function of time, $\tau(t)$, which requires the SOC to solve for the first-order derivative (frequency offset or clock drift) and the second-order derivative (Doppler shift) simultaneously.

### 3. The Physical "Optical Bench" Layout

Inside the stationary lab at the base of the Coudé path, the hardware is laid out on a vibration-isolated honeycomb table:

- **Fiber-to-Free-Space Launch**: The quantum signal usually arrives via fiber from the EPS/WCP source and is converted to a "free-space" beam via a high-quality collimator.
- **Beam Splitters**: Dichroic mirrors separate the 808 nm beacon (for tracking) from the 785 nm quantum signal (for key distribution) and the 1550 nm classical link.
- **Fast Steering Mirrors (FSM)**: Small, piezo-actuated mirrors that make micro-adjustments (thousands of times per second) to keep the beam centered in the Coudé path, correcting for any mechanical "wobble" in the large telescope gears.

### Comparison of Timing Challenges

| Factor | Challenge | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Clock Drift | Atomic clocks vary by ns/hour | Software Cross-Correlation |
| Time of Flight | Light takes ~2–10 ms to reach LEO | Orbital Propagator (TLE) |
| Jitter | Electronics have "noise" in timing | High-speed FPGA Time-Tagging |
| Atmosphere | Variable delay (minimal but present) | Adaptive Coincidence Windows |

## QEYSSat Mission Timeline

To verify that the quantum link is truly "quantum," the following timeline outlines the path to "First Light":

### QEYSSat Mission Timeline: The Road to "First Light"

The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and Honeywell have hit several major milestones recently. "First Light"—the first time the ground station and satellite successfully exchange photons—is the most anticipated event of the mission.

- **Late 2024 – Early 2025**: Ground Segment Readiness: The primary OQGS in St-Hubert and the transportable units undergo final calibration. This includes "star tracking" tests to ensure the Coudé path is mechanically aligned to arcsecond precision.
- **2025**: Launch: QEYSSat is currently scheduled for launch in 2025. It will be placed into a Sun-Synchronous Polar Orbit to ensure it passes over the Canadian ground stations at consistent local times (usually middle-of-the-night for low background noise).
- **Launch + 1-2 Months**: Commissioning Phase: After the satellite deploys its solar arrays and clears initial health checks, the "Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking" (PAT) phase begins.
- **"First Light" (Estimated late 2025)**: This occurs during the first successful Uplink Handshake. The ground station will fire its 808 nm beacon, the satellite will lock onto it and return its own beacon, and the first quantum time-tags will be recorded.
- **2026+**: Primary Science Mission: Once First Light is achieved and the SOC validates the S-value (Bell Test), the mission moves into full-scale QKD demonstrations across Canada.

## Post-Quantum Key Distribution and Encryption

Once the QEYSSat mission successfully generates a shared secret key between the ground station and the satellite, the focus shifts from quantum physics to classical cryptography. The goal of the mission is to provide "Quantum-Safe" security, which involves two distinct layers of encryption.

### 1. The "Golden Standard": One-Time Pad (OTP)

For the most sensitive scientific demonstrations, QEYSSat is designed to support One-Time Pad encryption.

**How it works**:
- The quantum-generated key is exactly the same length as the message being sent. The message is combined with the key using a bitwise XOR operation.

**Security**:
- This is the only mathematically proven "unbreakable" encryption, provided the key is truly random, used only once, and kept secret.

**Use Case**:
- Used for ultra-high-security government communications where the data volume is low but the secrecy requirement is permanent.

### 2. High-Speed Bulk Encryption: AES-256 (GCM)

Because generating quantum keys is slower than modern fiber-optic data rates, the most common practical use for QKD keys is as "Master Keys" for AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard).

**The Process**:
- QEYSSat provides a 256-bit quantum key which is fed into an AES-256 engine in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). This mode provides both encryption and integrity (proving the message wasn't tampered with).

**Key Rotation**:
- Instead of using the same AES key for weeks, the QKD system can "rotate" or refresh the AES key every few minutes or even seconds. This minimizes the amount of data at risk if a single key were ever compromised.

### 3. Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

A unique aspect of the QEYSSat mission and the Canadian strategy (often involving the National Research Council and IQC) is the "Hybrid" approach.

**Quantum + Math**:
- Since QKD requires a dedicated optical link, it isn't always available (e.g., during cloudy weather). To stay secure, the system combines QKD keys with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber (now standardized as ML-KEM).

**The Logic**:
- The data is encrypted in a way that an attacker would have to break both the quantum-distributed key and the complex mathematical PQC algorithm to read the message.

### Summary of Encryption Layers

| Method | Role | Primary Strength |
|--------|------|------------------|
| OTP (XOR) | Ultra-Secure Demo | Information-theoretic security (unbreakable) |
| AES-256 | Bulk Data Transfer | High speed and efficiency |
| Hybrid PQC | Fail-safe | Security even if the optical link is down |
| SHA-3 | Authentication | Ensures the "public" part of the QKD is genuine |

### 4. Key Management via "EvolutionQ"

The specific software used to handle these keys is often EvolutionQ's Basecamp, a Canadian-developed Key Management System (KMS).

- Takes the raw bits from the SOC.
- Buffers and stores them in a secure hardware security module (HSM).
- Delivers the keys to end-user applications (like a secure VPN or a banking database) via standardized APIs like ETSI GS QKD 014.

### The "Trusted Node" Relay

It is important to remember that QEYSSat itself doesn't usually encrypt your emails. Instead:

1. Ground Station A sends a key to the Satellite.
2. Ground Station B sends a key to the Satellite.
3. The Satellite performs an XOR of both keys and broadcasts the result.
4. Station A and B now have a shared secret they can use for AES-256 to talk to each other directly over the regular internet.

## Corporate Network Integration

To integrate specialized quantum hardware into standard corporate networks, QEYSSat and similar missions rely on vendor-neutral standards developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). These standards act as the "universal translator" between a quantum ground station and a typical enterprise server.

### 1. ETSI Standards for Corporate Integration

Two primary standards allow third-party applications to request and receive keys from the QKD system:

**ETSI GS QKD 014 (REST-based API)**:
- This is the primary "high-level" standard. It uses a RESTful API (HTTPS and JSON) that any modern developer can easily integrate into an application.
  - **GET_STATUS**: Allows a client to check if enough keys are available.
  - **GET_KEY**: Allows the first client (e.g., in a Montreal office) to grab a unique set of quantum keys.
  - **GET_KEY_WITH_ID**: Allows the second client (e.g., in a Vancouver office) to retrieve the exact same key by using a synchronized "Key ID".

**ETSI GS QKD 015 (SDN Control)**:
- This standard is used for Software-Defined Networking (SDN). It allows a central network controller to manage thousands of QKD links, discovering new nodes and automatically routing quantum keys to where they are needed most in the network.

### 2. Protecting "Key Delivery" on the Ground

Once a key is generated by the OQGS, it must be moved to the end-user without being intercepted. This "Last Mile" of delivery is protected using several defensive layers:

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS) Authentication**: The ETSI 014 interface requires mTLS. This means both the server and the client must present digital certificates to prove their identity before a single bit of the key is transmitted.
- **Secure Domains and Colocation**: To minimize risks, the Optical Quantum Ground Station and its associated Key Management System (KMS) are typically located within a shared, high-security domain (like a fenced government compound).
- **Tamper-Resistant Hardware**: Keys are stored in a Local KMS, which is a tamper-resistant server designed to zero-out its memory if someone tries to physically open the chassis.
- **Key Encapsulation**: When a key must travel between two buildings on the ground, it is often "encapsulated" inside a traditional high-security tunnel (like a VPN) that is itself hardened against quantum computers using Post-Quantum Cryptography.

### 3. Summary of Key Flow

1. **Quantum Level**: Photons arrive from the satellite at the OQGS.
2. **Storage Level**: The KMS stores the raw bits as "Master Keys."
3. **Request Level**: A corporate app (the SAE or Secure Application Entity) asks for a key via ETSI 014.
4. **Application Level**: The app uses that key to encrypt data with AES-256 and sends it over the regular internet.

## ETSI GS QKD 014 Integration Example

To finalize the connection between the Quantum EncrYption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) and a corporate network, the system uses standardized software interfaces.

### ETSI GS QKD 014 Sample JSON Response

The ETSI GS QKD 014 standard defines a RESTful API for key delivery. Below is a typical JSON response when a "Master" application (SAE) successfully requests a key for use with a "Slave" application at another location:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "key_ID": "8c3c8d07-4827-47b7-a61b-db9b95f01cb9",
      "key": "H7prwEw/MNN8AcpMnSUyt2fIXguhofof3qLt2O9uc5U="
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:
- **key_ID**: A unique UUID used to synchronize the specific key between the two communicating parties.
- **key**: The actual quantum-generated secret, typically encoded in Base64.
