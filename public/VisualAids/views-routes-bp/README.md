In web frameworks (like Flask), Routes map URLs to Python functions, Views are those functions handling request logic and returning responses (HTML, data), and Blueprints are organizational tools to modularize related routes/views into reusable components (like an "auth" or "admin" section) for cleaner, scalable projects, preventing clutter in the main app. Essentially, blueprints group views and routes, making large apps manageable by defining sections that can be easily added to the main application. 
Routes
Definition: A URL path (e.g., /users/profile) that your application listens for.
Mapping: Decorators (like @app.route) link a URL to a specific View function.
Types: Can be static (/about) or dynamic (e.g., /posts/<id>), capturing parts of the URL as parameters. 
Views (or View Functions)
Definition: The Python function that executes when a specific route is hit.
Logic: Contains the code to process the request (get data, check session, etc.).
Response: Returns data (HTML via render_template, JSON, redirects) that becomes the web response. 
Blueprints
Definition: A way to structure an application by grouping related routes, templates, and static files into a single module.
Purpose: Organizes code, making apps modular and scalable (e.g., separate blueprints for blog, admin, auth).
Usage: You define routes on the blueprint (@bp.route) instead of the app, then register the whole blueprint with the main app (app.register_blueprint(bp)).
Benefits: Promotes reusable components, better organization, and easier development of large applications. 
Analogy
Think of your Application as a building.
Routes are the signposts on the roads leading to different rooms (e.g., "Admin Entrance").
Views are the activities happening inside each room (e.g., the "Login View" handles login logic).
Blueprints are entire wings or departments (e.g., the whole "Admin Wing" with its own entrance, login, dashboard) that can be built and added to the main building.
