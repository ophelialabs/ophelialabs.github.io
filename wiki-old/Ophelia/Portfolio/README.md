# Prominent U.S. Launch Vehicles
## Atlas
Lockheed Martin's Atlas family of launch vehicles is on of the largest commercial launch vehicle lines in the United States. Four Atlas launch vehicles are included in the launch vehicle database. The Atlas IIA has an upgraded RL 10 engine with optional nozzle extension for the Centaur stage. The Atlas IIIA (2000) is a re-engineered Atlas II, utilizing a high-performance RD-180 engine from Russia. The Atlas IIIB has a stretched Centaur that can use single or dual Centaur configurations.

## Delta
Following the Challenger shuttle disaster in 1986, President Reagan announced that the Space Shuttle would carry no more commercial payloads. To fill this gap, the Delta II was built by Boeing (1989) to launch medium-sized NASA payloads and small commercial payloads. The Delta III includes a larger fairing, larger strap-on motors, and a cryogenic second stage. The Delta IV line of medium-to-heavy launch vehicles is Boeing's most advanced product in the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program. The Delta IV Heavy is capable of delivering a payload directly to GEO orbit.
